# Number Guesser Application

This simple application generates a random number within a specific range initially from 1 to 2. The user guesses within the requested range, if guessed correctly the player will move a stage foward. 
Moving a stage foward will increase the generated number range (i.e, from "1 to 2", to "1 to 3" and so on). If guessed wrong it will be requested to start the game over.


## Breaking it down (series of tasks that have to be performed to achieve the goals)

1. A promt messege requesting the user's/player's name and setting it to the player's name panel.
2. Generating a random number within the specified range (initialy from 1 to 2).
3. creating a functiom to check guessing number, if it's correct.
4. Creating a function to increament the range in a correct guess and request to start over in a wrong guess.
5. Creating a function to reset the game while restarting it.
6. Funtions are created for sound notification.
