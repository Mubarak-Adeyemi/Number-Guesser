# Number Guesser Application

This simple application generates a random number within a specific range, initially from 1 to 2. The user guesses within the requested range. If the player guesses correctly, they will move a stage forward. 
Moving a stage forward expands the number range generated (for example, from "1 and 2" to "1 and 3," and so on). If guessed wrong, it will be requested to start the game over.


## Breaking it down (series of tasks that have to be performed to achieve the goals)

1. A promt message requesting the user's or player's name and setting it to the player's name panel.
2. Generating a random number within the specified range (initialy from 1 to 2).
3. Creating a function to determine weather or not the guessed number is correct.
4. Developing a function to increament the range in a correct guess and requesting a retry in a wrong guess
5. Adding a function to restart the game and reset it.
6. Functions are created for sound notification.
